# accentable
Accentable is an AutoHotKey helper for using chords to make accents, based on how such shortcuts work in Microsoft Office.

Download the latest version here on the [Releases page](https://github.com/gfsl/accentable/releases).

Or you can run from the `.ahk` script with [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

All shortcuts are in the format Ctrl+Accent, release, Letter.
For example, `Ctrl+^, o` produces ô.

Accents supported are grave (à, \`), acute (é, '), circumflex (ô, ^), umlaut (ü, :), tilde (ñ, ~) and cedilla (ç, ,). As a bonus, there's also `Ctrl+#, $` for £ and `Ctrl+=, Y` for ¥.

You can enable or disable the shortcuts using the tray icon.
